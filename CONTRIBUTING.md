# Contribute To Algolia Snippet Library

The Algolia code snippet library is a community-maintained repository and so contributions are always welcome.

## Submitting a Snippet

To submit a code library for inclusion in the library, please fork the repository and then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/algolia-snippet-library/pulls).

### Guidelines for submission:

- Each snippet should ideally be related to working with WP Search with Algolia specifically. We will consider general Algolia snippets, but the primary focus is customizing WP Search with Algolia's integration.
- Each snippet should be placed in it's own file.
- Each file should be named appropriately based on the purpose of the snippet.
- Files should be placed in the appropriate category (folder). If no category exists, you may create one with your pull request.
- For consistency, all callback functions should be prefixed with `wds_algolia_`.
- (optional) Add [WordPress plugin headers](http://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header#Plugin_File_Header_Example) to allow others to use your snippet as a plugin.
