Algolia Snippet Library
========================

This is a commumity-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify and customize behavior for [WP Search with Algolia](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wp-search-with-algolia/) and general Algolia integration.

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.
